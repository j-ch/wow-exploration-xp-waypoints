# wow-exploration-xp-waypoints

I use these coordinates to level Earthen characters to 70 in World of Warcraft by flying around and exploring.

Each zone probably has missing coordinates.

# Using these lists

The addons I use to take advantage of these lists are TomTom and CopyPasta2
* https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom
* https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/copypasta2

So if I were exploring Howling Fjord I would:
1. make sure I'm in Howling Fjord in WoW
2. open wrath_howling_fjord.txt
3. copy the list of /way commands
4. back in WoW, type **/paste show** (this is a CopyPasta2 addon command)
5. paste your list and seledt **Paste and Close**

You should now have a bunch of Howling Fjord TomTom waypoints placed on your map. Follow them.

# Finding your own coordinates

If you have a preferred zone you want to contribute coordinates from, you can use this WeakAura I modified: https://wago.io/9sesARgGP. To use it, make sure you have "Enable Debug Logging" turned on, fly your zone, then check the debug log for your output.
