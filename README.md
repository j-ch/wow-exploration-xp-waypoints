# wow-exploration-xp-waypoints

I use these coordinates to level Earthen characters to 70 in World of Warcraft by flying around and exploring.

Each zone probably has missing coordinates.

If you have a preferred zone you want to contribute coordinates from, you can use this WeakAura I modified: https://wago.io/9sesARgGP. To use it, make sure you have "Enable Debug Logging" turned on, fly your zone, then check the debug log for your output.
